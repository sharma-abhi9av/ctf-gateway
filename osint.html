    <p>
      <strong>WhiteTiger-929</strong> AKA WhiteTiger is a mysterious cybercriminal known for orchestrating attacks on vulnerable websites.  
      His alias, inspired by a rare Siberian white tiger sighting in 2019 (which also marked his first major breach), reflects his elusiveness and precision.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Username: <code>WhiteTiger-929</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We think you're the right person for this job. Good luck, agent.
